# Fonts

Anno 1602 comes with a few different bitmap fonts. They are encoded inside `.ZEI` files in the `TOOLGFX` folder.

The filenames have the following format: `ZEI<HEIGHT><TYPE>.ZEI`, where `HEIGHT` is the height of the font and
`TYPE` can be one of
- ``: ?
- `A`: normal sans serif
- `V`: bold sans serif
- `G`: serif
- `H`: Especially high and thin letters
