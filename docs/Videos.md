# Videos

The Annno 1602 CD comes with a `VideoSmk` folder. The `.smk` files within can be decoded into a modern format using 
`ffmpeg`: 

    for i in *.smk; do ffmpeg -i "$i" -strict -2 "${i%.*}.ogg"; done
    
The following table provides an overview over the videos.
The `id` is taken from the video's filename (e.g., `110.smk`).
The `editor number` is the number displayed in the editor when selecting the win-game video.
The `editor save number` is the number corresponding to the `editor number` which is being saved to disk.

| id   | editor number | editor save number | length | player | description                                                                          |
